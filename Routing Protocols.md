# Most commonly used routing protocols 

## RIP - Routing Information Protocol 

The Routing Information Protocol is a distance-vector protocol with the hop-count as the primary metric. 
The maximum amount of hops is limited to 15. 
Implementations include the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown to mitigate the spread of faulty routing information. RIP can be classified into three versions. Version one (RIPv1) broadcasts its routing information every 30 seconds which is insertet into the reaching-network table of neighboring routers. 
The second version (RIPv2) carries subnet informaiton and thus supports classless inter-domain routing (CIDR). The next generation (RIPng) is an extension of RIPv2 which supports IPv6.
